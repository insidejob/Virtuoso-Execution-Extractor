# V10.2 Critical Environment Variable Fix

## Critical Issue Discovered

### The Problem
The variable extractor was using **ALL environments** instead of the **specific environment** used by the execution!

### Example of the Bug
```
Execution 88727 used environment 2418 (iPermit):
- iPermit env: url = "https://mobile-pretest.dev.iamtechapps.com/#/login" ‚úÖ

But also had environment 4022 (Demo):  
- Demo env: url = "https://reqres.in" ‚ùå

Result: Could get WRONG value from wrong environment!
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Code (WRONG)
```javascript
extractEnvironmentValues(environmentData) {
    environmentData.forEach(env => {  // Loops through ALL environments!
        env.variables.forEach(var => {
            envVarValues.set(var.name, var.value);  // Last one wins!
        });
    });
}
```

**Issues**:
1. Processes ALL environments, not just the one used
2. If multiple environments have same variable name, result is unpredictable
3. Ignores which environment the execution actually used

### Fixed Code (V10.2)
```javascript
extractEnvironmentValues(environmentData, executionData) {
    // Get the specific environment ID from execution
    const targetEnvId = executionData?.environmentId;
    
    environmentData.forEach(env => {
        // ONLY use the environment that matches execution
        if (targetEnvId && env.id !== targetEnvId) {
            return; // Skip other environments
        }
        
        // Process variables from correct environment
        env.variables.forEach(var => {
            envVarValues.set(var.name, var.value);
        });
    });
}
```

## How Executions Choose Environments

1. **Execution has `environmentId` field**
   ```json
   {
     "id": 88727,
     "environmentId": 2418,  // This execution uses iPermit environment
     "status": "FINISHED"
   }
   ```

2. **Must match with environment data**
   ```json
   [
     {"id": 2418, "name": "iPermit", "variables": {...}},  // ‚úÖ Use this
     {"id": 4022, "name": "Demo", "variables": {...}}      // ‚ùå Ignore this
   ]
   ```

## Environment Variable Inheritance

### Discovery
Each variable has an `inherited` flag:
```json
{
  "name": "url",
  "value": "https://...",
  "inherited": false  // Not inherited from parent
}
```

### Implementation
```javascript
// Handle inherited variables
if (!envVarValues.has(varData.name) || !varData.inherited) {
    envVarValues.set(varData.name, varData.value);
}
```
- Non-inherited variables take precedence
- Inherited variables only used if not already defined

## Test Results

### Before Fix (V10.1)
Could get wrong environment's values:
- Might get Demo's URL instead of iPermit's
- Unpredictable which environment "wins"

### After Fix (V10.2)
```bash
Execution 88727 (uses environment 2418 - iPermit):
$url = "https://mobile-pretest.dev.iamtechapps.com/#/login" ‚úÖ
```

Correctly uses ONLY the iPermit environment's values!

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: CRITICAL üî¥
- Could extract wrong variable values
- Would cause test failures if wrong environment used
- Affects all extractions with multiple environments

### Scope
- Affects: All projects with multiple environments
- Frequency: Every extraction where environments have overlapping variables

## Files Updated

**core/variable-extractor.js**:
- Line 212: Updated `extractEnvironmentValues` signature
- Line 219-224: Get environment ID from execution
- Line 228-231: Only process matching environment
- Line 237-240: Handle inheritance
- Line 41: Pass executionData to extraction

## Key Learnings

1. **Execution Context Matters**
   - Always use execution's specific environment
   - Don't assume all environments are equal

2. **Variable Priority**
   ```
   1. Execution sideEffects (runtime) - highest
   2. Specific environment variables
   3. Inherited environment variables
   4. Default/fallback values - lowest
   ```

3. **Data Relationships**
   ```
   Execution ‚Üí environmentId ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí variables
   ```
   Must follow this chain correctly!

## Backwards Compatibility

If no executionData provided:
- Falls back to processing ALL environments (old behavior)
- Ensures existing code doesn't break
- But should always pass executionData when available

## Status: FIXED ‚úÖ

The extractor now correctly:
1. Uses the specific environment from execution
2. Handles inheritance properly
3. Gets correct variable values
4. Maintains backwards compatibility
