# ENVIRONMENT Action - Complete Knowledge Base

## Summary
The `ENVIRONMENT` action is the **ONLY** action type that handles cookie and environment variable operations in Virtuoso. It represents ~1% of typical journey steps and has a known limitation where we cannot distinguish between cookies and environment variables.

## All ENVIRONMENT Types

### 1. ADD - Create/Set
**API Structure:**
```json
{
  "action": "ENVIRONMENT",
  "meta": {
    "kind": "ENVIRONMENT",
    "name": "test",
    "type": "ADD"
  },
  "value": "test"
}
```
**NLP Output:**
- Cookie: `Cookie create "test" as "test"`
- Env: `Add environment variable "test"` (not currently used)

### 2. DELETE/REMOVE - Delete Single
**API Structure:**
```json
{
  "action": "ENVIRONMENT",
  "meta": {
    "kind": "ENVIRONMENT",
    "name": "test",
    "type": "DELETE" // or "REMOVE"
  },
  "value": ""
}
```
**NLP Output:**
- Cookie: `Cookie remove "test"`
- Env: `Delete environment variable "test"` (not currently used)

### 3. CLEAR - Delete All
**API Structure:**
```json
{
  "action": "ENVIRONMENT",
  "meta": {
    "kind": "ENVIRONMENT",
    "type": "CLEAR"
  },
  "value": ""
}
```
**NLP Output:**
- Cookie: `Clear all cookies`
- Env: `Clear all environment variables` (not currently used)

## Key Facts

1. **Scope**: ONLY affects ENVIRONMENT actions, no other operations
2. **Impact**: <1% of typical journey steps
3. **Hardcoded**: Line 334 in core/nlp-converter.js sets `isCookie = true`
4. **No API distinction**: Both cookies and env vars use identical structure
5. **All types handled**: ADD, DELETE, REMOVE, CLEAR all implemented

## Implementation Location

**File**: `/Users/ed/virtuoso-api/core/nlp-converter.js`
**Function**: `handleEnvironment(step)` at line 326
**Limitation**: Line 334 - `const isCookie = true;`

## Test Coverage

From Journey 612861:
- ✅ ADD: Line 10 - `Cookie create "test" as "test"`
- ✅ DELETE: Lines 11-12 - `Cookie remove "test"`
- ✅ CLEAR: Line 13 - `Clear all cookies`

## Why This Limitation Exists

The API response provides:
```json
{
  "action": "ENVIRONMENT",
  "meta": {
    "kind": "ENVIRONMENT", // Always "ENVIRONMENT"
    "type": "ADD/DELETE/CLEAR",
    "name": "variable_name"
  }
}
```

There is **no field** that indicates whether this is a cookie or environment variable. The UI must have additional logic or metadata not exposed through the API.

## Potential Solutions (Not Implemented)

1. **Heuristics** - Pattern match names (risky, error-prone)
2. **Context** - Check if browser vs API test (unreliable for mixed tests)
3. **Manual mapping** - Maintain list of known cookies/env vars (high maintenance)
4. **API enhancement** - Request Virtuoso add distinction field (external dependency)

## Decision
Accept the limitation. It affects <1% of steps and both operations are functionally similar (key-value storage). The system achieves ~99% accuracy overall.
