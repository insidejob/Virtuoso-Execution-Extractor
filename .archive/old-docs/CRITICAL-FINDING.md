# üî¥ CRITICAL FINDING - API Access Issue

## The Discovery

After exhaustive testing, we've discovered:

1. **Only 1 endpoint works**: `/auth/sso` (without authentication)
2. **ALL other endpoints fail**: 401 Unauthorized with your token
3. **No Job IDs found**: Cannot list or access any executions

## The Core Issue

Your token `9e141010-eca5-43f5-afb9-20dc6c49833f` is being rejected by ALL authenticated endpoints.

### Test Results:
- ‚ùå `/executions/88715/status` ‚Üí 401
- ‚ùå `/projects/4889` ‚Üí 401
- ‚ùå `/testsuites/527218` ‚Üí 401
- ‚ùå `/jobs` ‚Üí 401
- ‚ùå ALL listing endpoints ‚Üí 401 or 404

## The Only Explanations

Since you say it works in Postman, one of these MUST be true:

### 1. Different Token in Postman
The token in Postman is NOT `9e141010-eca5-43f5-afb9-20dc6c49833f`

**Check**: In Postman ‚Üí Authorization tab ‚Üí Current Token Value
- Is it EXACTLY this token?
- Or is there a different/newer token?

### 2. Postman Has Session Cookies
Postman might have cookies from a previous OAuth login that make it work.

**Check**: In Postman ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí api-app2.virtuoso.qa
- Are there session cookies?
- Try: Disable cookies and test again

### 3. Different Environment
Postman might be hitting a different server.

**Check**: In Postman, is the URL exactly:
- `https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/88715/status`
- Or is it different?

### 4. OAuth Flow Required
The SSO response shows you need to complete OAuth:
```
https://oauth.sso.app2.virtuoso.qa/oauth2/authorize...
```

This would give you a proper API token.

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

### Please do ONE of these:

**Option A: Share Postman's Exact Request**
1. In Postman, make the working request
2. Click **Code** button
3. Select **cURL - bash**
4. Copy EVERYTHING and paste here

**Option B: Get Fresh Token**
1. Complete the OAuth flow from SSO URL
2. Get the new token
3. Share that token

**Option C: Check Postman Console**
1. View ‚Üí Show Postman Console
2. Clear console
3. Make the request
4. Screenshot what it shows

## The Bottom Line

The token `9e141010-eca5-43f5-afb9-20dc6c49833f` does NOT work with the API. 

If it works in Postman, then Postman is:
- Using a different token
- Has additional cookies/session
- Hitting a different endpoint

We need to see EXACTLY what Postman is doing to replicate it.
