```

## 🔑 Key Discovery: Execution Data > Journey Data

### Why Execution Data is More Valuable:
- **Journey Data**: Shows the test template (what should happen)
- **Execution Data**: Shows actual results (what did happen)

## 📊 What Execution Data Provides

### Journey Data Shows:
```json
{
  "step": "Click login button",
  "selector": "#login"
}
```

### Execution Data Shows:
```json
{
  "step": "Click login button",
  "selector": "#login",
  "status": "failed",
  "duration": 10000,
  "error": "Element not found",
  "screenshot": "failure.png",
  "aiSuggestion": "Try selector '#signin-button' instead",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-10T14:23:45Z"
}
```

## 🚀 How to Extract Execution 86339 Data

### Option 1: API Calls (Requires API Token)

```bash
# Primary execution data
GET https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/analysis/86339

# Detailed results
GET https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/86339/suites/527257/results

# Failure analysis
POST https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/86339/failures/explain

# Performance metrics
GET https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/86339/metrics
```

### Option 2: Browser Extraction (Works with UI Token)

1. **Open the execution URL**:
   ```
   https://app2.virtuoso.qa/#/project/4889/execution/86339/journey/527257
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12)

3. **Run the extraction script**:
   ```javascript
   // Copy entire contents of EXTRACT-EXECUTION-DATA.js
   ```

4. **Get your data**:
   - Type `extractedExecutionData` to view
   - Type `downloadExecutionData()` to save

## 💡 Key Insights from Execution Data

### The Example Response Shows:
- **Status**: Failed
- **Duration**: 48.6 seconds
- **Failed at**: Checkpoint 4 (Dashboard verification)
- **Root Cause**: Element selector changed
- **AI Fix**: Change selector from `h1.dashboard-title` to `h1.page-title`
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, DOM snapshots, console logs

### Execution-Exclusive Information:
1. **Real Performance**: Page loaded in 2.1 seconds
2. **Network Errors**: Dashboard API returned 500
3. **Console Errors**: JavaScript error in dashboard.js
4. **Historical Context**: Was passing, started failing today
5. **AI Analysis**: 87% confidence in suggested fix

## 🎯 The Power of Execution Data

### Answers These Questions:
1. ✅ **Why did it fail?** Element selector changed
2. ✅ **When did it start?** Today at 14:23
3. ✅ **How to fix it?** Update selector to h1.page-title
4. ✅ **What else broke?** Dashboard API is returning 500
5. ✅ **Is it consistent?** Was passing before, new failure
6. ✅ **What's the impact?** 1 checkpoint failed, 3 steps skipped

## 🔄 Complete Extraction Process

```javascript
// 1. Extract execution overview
const execution = getExecutionData(86339);

// 2. Analyze results
execution.checkpoints.forEach(checkpoint => {
  console.log(`${checkpoint.name}: ${checkpoint.status}`);
  if (checkpoint.status === 'failed') {
    console.log(`  Error: ${checkpoint.error}`);
    console.log(`  Fix: ${checkpoint.aiSuggestion}`);
  }
});

// 3. Get performance metrics
console.log(`Total duration: ${execution.duration}ms`);
console.log(`Failed steps: ${execution.failedSteps}`);
console.log(`Success rate: ${execution.passRate}%`);
```

## ✨ Summary

**Execution data is 10x more valuable than journey data** because it contains:

1. **Actual Results** - Not just the plan
2. **Failure Details** - Exactly what went wrong
3. **AI Analysis** - Smart suggestions for fixes
4. **Visual Evidence** - Screenshots and videos
5. **Performance Data** - Real timings and metrics
6. **Historical Context** - Trends and patterns

Use the browser script (`EXTRACT-EXECUTION-DATA.js`) to extract this rich execution data even with your UI-only token!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the browser extraction script** on execution page
2. **Analyze the failure details** in the extracted data
3. **Apply the AI-suggested fixes** to your journeys
4. **Track performance trends** across executions

The execution data gives you everything you need to understand, debug, and fix test failures!
