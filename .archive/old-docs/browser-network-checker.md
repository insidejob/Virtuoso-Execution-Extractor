# API Authentication Debugging Guide

## üîç We Need Your Help to Match Your Successful API Call

Since you're successfully making API calls through the documentation interface but our scripts are getting 401 errors, there must be additional headers or cookies being sent that we're not aware of.

## Please Follow These Steps:

### 1. Open Browser DevTools Network Tab
- Open the API documentation page where you successfully tested
- Press F12 to open DevTools
- Go to the **Network** tab
- Clear any existing requests (üö´ button)

### 2. Make a Successful API Call
- Use the API documentation interface to test `/executions/88715/status`
- Make sure it returns a successful response

### 3. Find the Request in Network Tab
- Look for the request to `/executions/88715/status`
- Click on it to see details

### 4. Check These Specific Items:

#### A. Request Headers Tab
Look for and share these headers:
- `Authorization`: (should be "Bearer 9e141010...")
- `Cookie`: (any cookies being sent?)
- `X-XSRF-Token`: (CSRF token?)
- `X-Session-Id`: (session ID?)
- Any other `X-` headers

#### B. Cookies Tab
Check if any cookies are being sent:
- Session cookies
- Auth cookies
- CSRF tokens

#### C. Right-Click ‚Üí Copy as cURL
- Right-click on the successful request
- Select "Copy" ‚Üí "Copy as cURL"
- Paste it here so we can see the exact format

## üéØ What We're Looking For:

The API documentation interface might be:
1. **Sending session cookies** from your logged-in UI session
2. **Including CSRF tokens** that we don't have
3. **Using a different Authorization format**
4. **Sending additional headers** that establish context

## Example of What to Look For:

```bash
# The cURL command might look like:
curl 'https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/88715/status' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 9e141010-eca5-43f5-afb9-20dc6c49833f' \
  -H 'Cookie: session=abc123; XSRF-TOKEN=xyz789' \  # <-- These cookies
  -H 'X-XSRF-TOKEN: xyz789' \                         # <-- Or these headers
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

## üí° Quick Alternative Test:

Try this in your browser console while on the API docs page:

```javascript
// This will show all cookies available
document.cookie

// This will try to make the API call using the browser's context
fetch('https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api/executions/88715/status', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer 9e141010-eca5-43f5-afb9-20dc6c49833f',
        'Accept': 'application/json'
    },
    credentials: 'include'  // This includes cookies
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

## üìã Information We Need:

1. **Full cURL command** from a successful request
2. **All cookies** shown in the Cookies tab
3. **Any X- headers** that might be authentication-related
4. **The response** you get (to confirm it's working)

Once we have this information, we can update our scripts to exactly match what the API documentation interface is doing!
