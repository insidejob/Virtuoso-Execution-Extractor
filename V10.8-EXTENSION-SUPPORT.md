# V10.8 - Extension and JavaScript Execution Support

## Critical Gap Discovered
During review, we discovered that the EXECUTE action type was completely missing from our core NLP converter. This represents a significant category of Virtuoso test actions that handle:
- JavaScript execution in browser
- Browser extension/plugin calls
- Custom commands
- Third-party integrations

## What Was Missing
The `EXECUTE` action type with two main variants:
1. **JavaScript Execution**: `target.type: "JAVASCRIPT"` - Execute custom JavaScript code
2. **Extension Execution**: `target.type: "EXTENSION"` - Execute browser extension functionality

## Implementation (V10.8)

### Core Changes
Added to `/Users/ed/virtuoso-api/core/nlp-converter.js`:

1. **New case in main switch statement** (line 251-252):
```javascript
case 'EXECUTE':
    return this.handleExecute(step);
```

2. **New handleExecute method** (lines 272-306):
- Handles JavaScript execution with script truncation for readability
- Handles extension execution with extension ID/name
- Supports output variable storage
- Provides fallback for unknown execution types

## NLP Output Examples

### JavaScript Execution
```
Execute JavaScript "document.querySelector('.button').click()"
Execute JavaScript "return document.title" and store result in $pageTitle
Execute JavaScript "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)..."
```

### Extension Execution
```
Execute extension "screenshot-extension"
Execute extension "data-scraper" and store result in $scraped_data
Execute browser extension
```

## Test Coverage
- JavaScript execution with inline scripts
- JavaScript execution with output variables
- Extension execution by ID
- Extension execution with output variables
- Fallback for unknown execution types

## Impact on Accuracy
This fix is critical for maintaining our ~99% accuracy claim:
- Previously: EXECUTE actions were completely unhandled
- Now: Full support for JavaScript and extension execution
- Result: No more gaps in extension/custom script handling

## Version Update
- **Previous**: V10.7 (without extension support)
- **Current**: V10.8 (complete extension support)

## Backwards Compatibility
The change is fully backwards compatible:
- Existing extractions continue to work
- Unknown EXECUTE types gracefully fallback to generic handling
- No changes to API or output format

## Testing Recommendation
Test with journeys containing:
1. JavaScript execution steps
2. Browser extension calls
3. Custom script execution
4. Output variable storage from execution
